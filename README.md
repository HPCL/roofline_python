# roofline_python

There are two versions of the roofline generator, the python notebook and the python script.

Use the python notebook in either google colab or jupyter notebook and create a roofline plot with or without application points from a json (right now generated by the Berkeley ERT)

Dependencies:
* Anaconda 
* Seaborn (you can conda install seaborn, or pip install seaborn)

To run the script version here are the parameters:
* input (-i): Path to the roofline JSON file
* outfile (-o): The output SVG file path/name (this is where/how you want your plot saved)
* appdata (-a): Path to the CSV file that contains application performance data
* table (-t): Include the config information in a table next to the roofline plot, using -t means you want the table
  
Example:
~~~
python3 roofline_python.py -i roofline.json -o roofline.svg -a appdata.csv -t
~~~
